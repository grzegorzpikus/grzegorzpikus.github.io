							<h3>Class Diagram</h3>
							<p>Reflections:</p>
							<p>The exercise was about creating Class Diagram for a supermarket. If it was a software for an online supermarket I would definitely stay with Customer Class. However, if it was a regular supermarket, a Customer Class would not be necessary in my opinion.  I improved my class diagram by adding proper relationships, and I realized that no all variables and methods should have be public. </p>
							<img src="images2/Class Diagram_improved.jpg"><p></p>
							<p>Learning outcomes:<br>

							1) I have gain an ability to read and analyse class diagrams, to implement their structure into code/script. Moreover, I am able to do my own system design and organize my ideas in class diagrams showing proper relationships and inheritance. <br>

							2) Class diagrams are very useful graphical representation of system design in OOP. However, it is important to properly choose what element of system should be a class. If it has data and behaviour, it should be a class. However it doesn’t mean that data without behaviour should not be represented by a class. It can, and this approach can be clearly found in Kotlin, in which Data Classes are commonly used.<br>

							3) There are three steps of creating class diagrams: a) Identify classes, its attributes and behaviours; b) find relationships between classes; c) Create the structure of the system based on classes and their relationships.<br>

							4) I have learnt variety of relationships between classes that are implemented in class diagrams: association, dependency, aggregation, composition inheritance.<br>
							5) Encapsulation is a very important aspect of object oriented programming. Private variables basically cannot be accessible form outside of classes. Protected variables, however, are accessible only for subclasses.</p>
							</p>
							<h3>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</h3>
							<p>UML is a specialized language that consists a few diagrams. Those diagrams formally describe the structure of the software and its processes. Within the course I have learned three type of diagrams that belong to UML: a class diagram, a sequence diagram and activity diagram. For one of the seminar, my task was to prepare these diagrams based on the described scenario. Below I present my proposal:</p>
                            <p><img src="images2/UML1.jpg"></p>
							<p><img src="images2/UML2.jpg"></p>
							<p><img src="images2/UML3.jpg"></p>
							<p>Proposed improvements</p>
							<p>The Class Diagram:<br>
							Doctor Class should have another attribute – a list of assigned patients to it. The list should keep no more than 500 Patient objects currently having booked appointment to a doctor, because I used aggregation relationship.<br>
							b) The relationship between Prescription and Appointment is composition. The appointment should have another attribute prescription (None from default), and it could be overwritten by a doctor if a prescription is needed. <br>
							c) Patient Class don’t have “request appointment” and “repeat prescription request” methods. That is a major mistake in my design.  And if the Patient class may request for renewing prescription, Patient and Prescription class should be associated.</p>
							<p>The Activity Diagram:<br>
							<p>a) The action starts too late form “make an appointment”. It should start form Patient “request an appointment”, and provide all necessary data. I improved my activity diagram below:</p>
							<p><img src="images2/UML4.jpg"></p>
							<p>Learning outcomes:<br>
							1) The sequence diagram is used to describe interactions between objects along with statements/actions that are sent between them. The basic purpose of SD is modelling how the system works, and it helps to have an overview of the communication between objects.<br>
							2) The activity diagram is a behavioural diagram that describes activity flow in the system. As far as I understood, this diagram shows the order of the actions what happens in the system step by step.<br>
							3) All these diagrams should complement each other to describe how the system works and they help with writing code based on the design architecture.</p>
