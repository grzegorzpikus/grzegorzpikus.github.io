							<h3>Information System (IS) Failure</h3>
							<p>In the discussion my colleagues referring to my post pointed out vary valuable aspect, which is importance of system testing. After decades of information system failures, tests (like unit tests, integration tests, system test and User Acceptance Testing) have become standards in modern IS (Umar 2020).  Nowadays, tests are as important as making software itself. Errors and bugs in the software may cause disproportionately huge after-effects that may influence not only hardware, goods, finances but also people’s lives, that is why they have to be found and eliminated as soon as possible. <br>
							<p>Learning outcomes:<br>
							Testing information systems are an integral part of making software. These two are inseparable elements of good coding practices and nowadays, variety of different tests like unit tests, integration tests, system tests as well as user acceptance tests are just standards.<br>
							2. Importance of testing: a) increase of quality which is linked to better performance of software. b) human factor (making mistakes) c) risk reduction d) gain and maintain customer (user) trust.</p>
							<h3>Alternatives to SQL</h3>
							<p>Relational databases have been commonly used since 70’ last century in many areas like business, science, financial institutions, or military. In all these places there are data accumulation and processing. That is why gaining, maintenance and processing of data are so important. Rational database have been undeniable useful tools for these. However every tool has its assets and drawbacks. The amount of data that that has increased for the last decades on theInternet (including cloud computing) is extraordinary, and reliable solutions like rationale database may not be sufficient. That is why new alternatives have been created like non-rational database (including NoSQL).<br>
							Learning outcomes:<br>
							1) The purpose of gathering and managing data should be a guideline what type of database would be suitable for the system we want to work with.<br>
							2) Traditional relation databases are ideal for complex querying, that follow ACID conventions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability). It would be a good choice for complex databases that would not significantly grow in time.<br>
							3) Non-rational databases (including NoSQL) are a new type of data management ideal for Big Data.<br>
							4) There is also an alternative for both of these – NewSQL, which is a subtype of classic SQL. It increases data consistency, queries run similarly to SQL, and can uses its extensions and has NoSQL clustering style. However, NewSQL does not work good with big datasets over than a few TB.</p>
