							<h3>IT Failures - collaboration in discussion</h3>
							<p>Information systems (IS) are present in every part of our lives, that is why we are so dependent on their free-of-error operations. More and more decisions and actions are made and coordinated by information systems and we users want to make sure that they are reliable. The world of IS is full of failure examples at every stage of the industry, science, transportation, communications etc. One, in my opinion, the most spectacular and expensive was an accident of a rocket Ariane 5 on the 4th of June 1996. This accident was caused by a bug in the software. Some part of the software was supposed to determine the position of the rocket relative to the earth (known as the horizontal bias - value BH). The value should have been represented by a 64-bit float, however, because of the bug in the software, the variable type was changed to a 16-bit integer. For the first 37 seconds of the launch, the rocket's velocity was low enough to keep information about the BH value in a 16-bit integer. When the velocity increased, the BH value was out of range and it caused an error in the system. The rocket was unable to keep a proper position relative to the earth. It rotated by 90 degrees and under aerodynamic forces was destroyed. Many years of work and $460 M was lost in just seconds. It was a turning point for the whole scientific society working on space programmes because this accident showed how important is critical software validation, and how one small change can cause significant repercussions. Fortunately, it was an unmanned program to release into orbit probes for magnetosphere examination. However, this disaster only showed that software engineers working on space programs are responsible not only for the success of spacecraft missions but most of all for the lives of astronauts during manned space flights. In the discussion, my colleagues referring to my post pointed out a very valuable aspect, which is the importance of system testing. After decades of information system failures, tests (like unit tests, integration tests, system tests and User Acceptance Testing) have become standards in modern IS [Umar, 2020]. Nowadays, tests that check system implementation are as important as making the software itself. Errors and bugs in the software may cause disproportionately huge after-effects that may influence not only hardware, goods, and finances but also people&rsquo;s lives, that is why they have to be found and eliminated as soon as possible.</p>

							<p>Learning outcomes:</p>

							<p>1. I and all other students in our posts, we do agree that testing information systems are an integral part of making software. These two are inseparable elements of good coding practices and noways, a variety of different tests like unit tests, integration tests, system tests as well as user acceptance tests are just standards.</p>

							<p>2. The reason why testing is so important is as follows: a) increase in quality which is linked to better performance of the software. b) human factor, making mistakes is a part of our humanity, we do them, but we also are aware of where they are and how to fix them. c) In different areas testing reduces risks, and I and other students presented how it is important and what disaster may be done without proper tests. d) gain customer trust, because the least tester on the way is always a user (customer), who wants a high-quality product, always.</p>

							<h3>IT Failures - Reflections on other posts</h3>
							<p>Banking along with almost any financial sector fully relies on Information systems (IS). There would be no progress in this branch of industry without development in IT sector. However, even though it is an obvious conclusion there have been numerous failures in banking systems that costs millions and effected their customers. One of them is mentioned RBS. Based on the first reports wrong update of CA-7 software, that automatizes banking processes (such as update of account balance). There are different sides of this financial disaster: outsourcing of system managemnet to India or lack of sufficient testing in the software. Another example that was mentioned in the forum was ATM breakdown in Mizuho Bank. Because of IS failures in this bank over than 4000 ATM stopped working correctly and that effected numerous number of its clients. These two accidents should be a warning sign for all IT sector working in financial institutes. In this case there is not only a matter of testing of software, it is a more complex issue. There should be more control in maintenance process. Banks should constantly invest in IT solutions that may prevent such disasters in future by monitoring their operations and evaluating when the IS should be update or changed.
							Moreover, Banks should put more effort on securing their software and databases. Centralization of these processes should be a good idea rather than outsourcing them to other institutions. Finally, a detailed security plan against IS failures needs to be created and applied, because it will help to minimize effects of any type of failures (systems, security etc).</p>
