							<h3>Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today.</h3>
								<p>It would be expected that high developed programming requires long and complicated code that can manage complex tasks. However, it is actually the opposite. Well written code that can handle demanding and complex problems should be as simple as possible. The less complex (loops, if statement etc.) code is, the more efficient it can work. And even more important, it is less prone to crash and generate bugs/errors. That is why cyclomatic complexity is a valuable paramiter that is commonly used in high level programming. Does it important from security point of view? of course it does! Bruce Schneier, Founder and CTO, Counterpane Internet Security, Inc. 2000 said: “The future of digital systems is complexity, and complexity is the worst enemy of security.” A Secure system is a system that is free of bugs and errors. The number of bugs increase with the complexity of the code. Moreover if software grows (it is longer and more complex), it may be an easy target for a hacker to exploit. It is important to point out that the complexity explosion in software in exponential. That is why developers should pay a lot of attention at maintaining the code simple with the same level of effectiveness to make it secure. </p>
